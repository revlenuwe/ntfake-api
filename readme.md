NTFake Api
=================
A simple Fake JSON API built with Nette + Vue.js

Web Server Setup
----------------

The simplest way to get started is to start the built-in PHP server in the root directory of your project:

	php -S localhost:8000 -t www

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see the **fake API response** generation page.

For Apache or Nginx, setup a virtual host to point to the `www/` directory of the project and you
should be ready to go.
